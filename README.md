## Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic Dataset
This is my first kernal and the objective of this kernal is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical modeling on the Titanic Dataset in order to gather insights and evenutally predicting survior(0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived). Out of the 891 passengers that went on board the titanic, approximately 38% of them got surived where as majority 62% did not survive the disaster.
The "Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic Dataset" project is a comprehensive study that delves into the historical data of the Titanic disaster. The project aims to uncover insights and patterns that may have contributed to the survival or demise of passengers. Using Python, the analysis explores various factors such as age, gender, class, and fare prices, among others, to determine their impact on survival rates.

- **Data Exploration**: The project begins with a thorough exploration of the Titanic dataset, examining the different types of data available and assessing their quality and completeness.
- **Visualization**: It employs a variety of visualization techniques to present the data in an easily understandable format, helping to identify trends and anomalies.
- **Statistical Analysis**: The project applies statistical methods to draw meaningful conclusions from the data, providing a deeper understanding of the factors that influenced survival.
- **Predictive Modeling**: As part of the Kaggle competition "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster," the project also involves building predictive models to estimate the likelihood of survival for each passenger based on their characteristics.

# I have outlined below the process i followed in conducting the aforementioned procedure
1.Import the relevant python libraies for the analysis
2.Load the train and test dataset and set the index if applicable
3.Visually inspect the head of the dataset,Examine the train dataset to understand in particular if the data is tidy, shape of the dataset,examine 
  datatypes, examine missing values, unique counts and build a data dictictionary dataframe
4.Run discriptive statistics of object and numerical datatypes, and finally transform datatypes accordingly
5.Carry-out univariate,bivariate and multivariate analysis using graphical and non graphical(some numbers represting the data) mediums
6.Feature Engineering : Extract title from name, Extract new features from name, age, fare, sibsp, parch and cabin
7.Preprocessing and Prepare data for statistical modeling
8.Statistical Modelling
